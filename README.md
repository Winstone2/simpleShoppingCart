Thought Process:

    Item Representation: Start by defining a structure to represent items. An object with properties like name, price, and quantity can be used to store this information.

    Cart Management: Create a container to hold the items in the cart. An array is a good choice for this.

    Add Items to Cart: Implement a function to add items to the cart. This function should take an item object, check if the item is already in the cart, and either update the quantity or add a new item to the cart array.

    Remove Items from Cart: Implement a function to remove items from the cart based on their name. Find the item in the cart array, update the quantity or remove the item if the quantity becomes zero.

    Calculate Total Cost: Write a function to iterate through the items in the cart, calculate the total cost by summing up the price of each item multiplied by its quantity.
    This code demonstrates how to create items, add them to the cart, remove items, and calculate the total cost of the items in the cart. You can adjust the item properties and quantities as needed, and use these functions to manage a simple shopping cart system.
